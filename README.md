School work and Bash scripts from CIT-173 (Linux Administration) and CIT-176 (UNIX Shell Programming).
Collection of Bash shell scripts by Robert A. Petersen (Sonikkua). Mail: Petersen.Mobile@Gmail.com.

Nothing too fancy, here are some Bash scripts I've written while taking Linux Administration and Linux Shell Scripting classes.

Will work on updating and ensuring proper running and updating comments. Most were written working through examples and 
quizes in Linux Essentials by Roderick Smith, and Unix Shell Programming 3rd Edition by Stephen Kochan.
